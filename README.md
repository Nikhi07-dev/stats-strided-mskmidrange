## 💻 System Requirements

To run this application, you will need:

- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Node.js**: Version 12 or higher
- **Browser**: Any modern browser (for the graphical user interface)

## 🔧 Features

- Calculate maximum and minimum values in a strided array.
- Easily work with custom masks for data selection.
- Outputs mid-range results simply and clearly.
- Intuitive interface designed for users without a programming background.

## 📊 How It Works

This application calculates the mid-range of a strided array using a mask. The strided array is a sequence of numbers where you can define a step size for selecting elements. The mask lets you filter which numbers to consider in the calculation. 

**Mid-range** is defined as:
\[ \text{Mid-range} = \frac{\text{Max} + \text{Min}}{2} \]

This formula provides a quick summary statistic that gives you the midpoint of the range.
